Paramotopy requires several libraries to successfully install.  These libraries are:

mpfr
gmp
bertini-serial
boost (>= 1.53)
mpich3

If these libraries have been installed in standard locations, i.e. /usr/local/include for header files and /usr/local/lib for library files, then the command

./configure

will work fine.

If you have the libraries installed in non-standard locations, you will need to add each location of the headers to the CPPFLAGS macro and the location of the libraries to the LDFLAGS macro.  For example, if you have mpfr, gmp, and bertini installed in /usr/local/mpfr, /usr/local/gmp, and /usr/local/bertini, respectively, then you would run

./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/mpfr/include -I/usr/local/gmp/include -I/usr/local/bertini/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/mpfr/lib -L/usr/local/gmp/lib -L/usr/local/bertini/lib"

If you are wanting to install with a particular compiler, or your compiler is not in the PATH location, you will need to run

./configure CXX="/path/to/g++" MPICXX="/path/to/mpic++"


If you have non-standard locations for libraries and a specific compiler to use, you can run, for instance


./configure CXX="/path/to/g++" MPICXX="/path/to/mpic++" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/mpfr/include -I/usr/local/gmp/include -I/usr/local/bertini/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/mpfr/lib -L/usr/local/gmp/lib -L/usr/local/bertini/lib"


Additional compiler flags can be added to CPPFLAGS, if desired.


After `./configure [OPTIONS]' has successfully ran, then you can install paramotopy with 

make; make install
